     1.0 Project Goals
  </h1>
  <p>	This research project’s objective is to delve into the experiences and cultural dynamics of African Americans residing in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, during the interwar period. Employing diverse research methodologies, this webpage hopes to deconstruct nuanced aspects of life within this Main Line community, highlighting both individual and general experiences from Ardmore during this time. Through historical inquiry guided by primary source materials, I aim to shed light on local tension and challenges by its residents. Coupling this project with various secondary sources and other scholarly analyses of the Main Line in Philadelphia additionally presents the opportunity to construct a more comprehensive picture of Ardmore from 1920-1940. </p>

      2.0 Broad Historical Context

    <p>The inter-war period was a time of great struggle for many Americans, with the 1920s bearing witness to a significant divergence in wealth between the top .9% and the bottom 90% of income-earners; this dissonance between the rich and poor was, undoubtedly, even greater for marginalized communities. <sup>1</sup>
 The Roaring Twenties only roared for a select few. While the period was often glamorized for its prohibition-era speakeasies and excesses, such indulgences were largely reserved for the privileged few, underscoring the inequalities of the time. 
   </p>
    
    <p> The onset of the Great Depression further exacerbated existing hardships, particularly for families already struggling economically. The town of Ardmore, Pennsylvania, functions as an illuminating case study on the stark differences between the lives of the uber-wealthy White Main Line Families and the groups sharing communities with them yet living under the poverty line. In the 1987 book Crabgrass Frontier, author Kenneth Jackson pulls a quote from a Main Line newspaper that remarks that “[we have] substantially, no middle class. We have the opulent class who occupy the country houses, on the one hand, and on the other, the laboring class and editors. By reading into primary documents on society, culture, and the ways of life in Ardmore that hail from the inter-war period, the prevalence and scope of the discriminatory practices inherent in the function of the community can begin to be deconstructed. 
    </p>
    
    <p> Turning to the above images, the first headline reads “Pennsylvania Bank Shuts,” and informs readers the Merion Title and Trust Company had to close its doors and hand over assets to the state. Yet, in June of that same year, tabloids were fawning over the Merion County Cricket Club and its hosting of the U.S. Open. They described the locale as a “swanky Philadelphia suburb,” and gave the rundown and the wealthy players who will soon be rolling in to participate. While this certainly functions as an imperfect and anecdotal example, it provides a contextual frame for the contrast between the struggles of the working-class citizens in the town and the opulence with which the uber-wealthy lived their lives. The divides in Ardmore appeared to run sharp, but by sifting through various types of historical sources then a fuller picture of the town, especially for Black communities traditionally relegated to the margins, can begin to come into view.

     <h3>
      3.0 Lower Merion Population Composition, 1920 and 1930 Census Data
    </h3>
     <img src="https://github.com/avelinepk/media/blob/main/1930census.jpg?raw=true" style="width:3000px; height: auto; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    
        <p> The census data from 1920 to 1930 paints a vivid picture of the rapid growth and changing demographics within Lower Merion township, home to Ardmore. In just a decade, the population surged from 23,866 inhabitants to 35,166, signaling a high influx of residents to this relatively small tract of land. This growth could have been partly due to the township’s general appeal, offering both the accessibility of city life and the serene ambiance of a small town. These characteristics can be seen across the Main Line, making the area an attractive decision for the affluent seeking refuge from the urban hustle and bustle. 
        </p>
         <p> Remarkably, despite this burgeoning population, Lower Merion Township remained predominantly white by 1930. The census reveals that out of 35,166 residents, 32,212 were White, with only 2,919 identified as Black.  However, there was a notable presence of foreign-born whites, comprising nearly 5,487 individuals–-this statistic includes those with foreign-born white parentage. Yet amidst this type of ethnic diversity, native-born whites overwhelmingly dominated the demographic landscape, numbering just shy of twenty-seven thousand individuals. 
        </p>
       <p> This demonstrates that the area had a limited amount of cultural diversity, and raises questions about the experiences and interactions among different ethnic and racial groups. Despite the dominance of native-born whites in Lower Merion township, the presence of foreign-born whites and their interactions with the Black community suggests a more nuanced social landscape. In section 3.1 we will explore these dynamics further, uncovering the diverse residential landscape of Ardmore and engaging in historical speculation about the potential impact of neighborhood cultural diversity.

    <h2>
     3.1 Ardmore Residency Map, 1920
    </h2>
    <p> Recently, students at Villa Nova University engaged in a geographic mapping and analysis project of Ardmore in the year 1920. You can access the wonderfully constructed project here: <a href="https://exhibits.library.villanova.edu/ardmore/general">Villa Nova Digital Exhibition.</a> They produced wonderful maps of the town of Ardmore, broken down by demographic group. By utilizing these maps in tandem with other sources, insight can be gained into the status of discrimination against marginalized communities within the town. The mapping of racial and ethnic groups is transposed onto an original map of the town in 1920. 
    </p>
     <img src="https://github.com/avelinepk/media/blob/main/Ardmore._Black_Italian_and_Irish_Combined.jpeg?raw=true" style="width: auto; height: auto; float: left; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">
       <p> Directly referencing the image, the key given by Villa Nova states that: black circles represent African American residents, white circles represent Italian immigrants, and striped circles represent Irish immigrants. As is apparent, Black residents and ethnic whites appear to be mostly relegated to the southern portion of the town. Unsurprisingly, the Bethel AME Church of Ardmore, established in 1816, sits chiefly in the part of town in which most of Ardmore’s Black residents lived.  
    </p>
       <p> While ethnic whites and Black populations live in close proximity to one another, one cannot help but notice that they are broken up by block or exist as multiple residencies in a row. In the northern part of the town both ethnic-white and Black populations appear to be occasionally scattered, but the densest part of the town appears to be separated by ethnic group through consecutive residences. Despite this separation, the groups must have inevitably interacted with each other. 
    </p>
       <p>The map also begins to make more sense when put in the context of the labor market. Both Black populations and ethnic whites likely worked in unskilled labor, and certain individuals ventured out to start their businesses. In the paper “Aspects of Italian Immigration in Philadelphia,” Joan Dickenson notes the Talone family tailor shop as one example of Italian immigrants translating their position as a craftsperson for the wealthy families in the town to a stand-alone business. I cannot say for certain whether the same opportunity arose for the Black populations within the neighborhood, but it seems unlikely given the overt racism present throughout the Main Line at the time. 
    </p>
    
  <h3> 4.0 “The Philadelphia Main Line Negro: A Social, Economic, and Education Survey” 
    </h3>
    <p> In 1938, a New Jersey public school superintendent self-published a book documenting the state of Black life on the Main Line.  <em> The Philadelphia Main Line Negro: A Social, Economic, and Education Survey </em>  promises its readers a comprehensive understanding of Black life, broken down through statistics and comparisons amongst the White populations in the area. The Philadelphia Main Line Negro is, in many ways, a product of its time. The comparative analyses given throughout the text offer little to no context on the racism that its surveyors inevitably faced and ultimately fall victim to common racist tropes present throughout America during the interwar period. Recognizing the shortcomings of such a text and attempting to understand it within the context of its production can provide a fruitful jumping-off point for understanding the state of race relations on the Main Line during the inter-war period. </p>
    <p> Being that the book is self-published, it likely was not subject to the same scrutiny that a publishing firm may have expected from a client in a more formal situation. Thus, other venues of inquiry should be used to validate the legitimacy of the source and evaluate the potential for truth behind the data that is reported within the text. Looking into 1940 census information on the author, Marvin Porch reveals that he was a city superintendent for public schools in Gloucester, New Jersey. Such a fact is significant because his background in education likely meant he was familiar with traditional research processes and we can thus, reconstruct this work charitably, hopefully lends itself to slightly more reliable data collection. It also tells us, however, that he was a White man in a position of public power, which could demonstrate the underlying purpose of this book—the subjugation of the Black population at a time when segregation within public schools in New Jersey was still completely permissible. Utilizing information about the life and occupation of the author can ultimately function to keep this work within the context of its time, reminding us to take caution in the reliability of information, even when it is presented in a seemingly reliable format such as a book or research study. </p>
    <p>Diving into the contents of the work reveals, both directly and indirectly, the status of the Black population on the Main Line during the later part of the inter-war period. Porch used data given to him by the Haverford Township School District, and cross-comparing that with data from the 1930 census for both Lower Merion Township and Haverford Township can convey information about the status of Black education on the Main Line. </p> 
   <figure>
    <figcaption style="clear: both; text-align: left;"> <b> Selection from <em> The Philadelphia Negro </em> </b> </figcaption>
    <img src="https://github.com/avelinepk/media/blob/main/Bookenrollment.jpg?raw=true" style="width: 500px; height: auto; float: left; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">   
  </figure>
 <p> Utilizing multiple sources, the information within the work can be used to outline the contours of what it may have looked like for residents of Ardmore at the same time. For example, Porch reveals Lower Merion Public High School had the second-highest enrollment of Black students by the percentage of all other public schools on the Main Line. We can also note that Porch mentions the declining rate of attendance of students past elementary school, something to be expected from the working-class population within the town. </p> 
<p> Comparing these statistics to the literacy rates given in Lower Merion and Haverford Townships in the 1930 Census proves useful in giving context to and fleshing out the nature of public schooling for Black students. As of 1930, 50 of the 324 persons reported illiterate in Lower Merion above the age of 10 were found to be Black, whereas, in Haverford Township, only 5 of 207 reported to be illiterate were Black. Contextualizing these statistics is helpful, because Lower Merion had a much higher Black population than Haverford, and ultimately only had a 1% higher instance of illiteracy amongst Black populations compared to the neighboring township.  Coupled with Porch’s reporting that Ardmore public schools had 216 Black pupils out of 548 total students gives greater context on the ability of residents to access basic and elementary-level education. Additionally, it reveals that the majority of Ardmore’s Black children likely attended school for at least a few years, having the opportunity to become literate during that time frame. </p> 
    
 
    
     <h3> 5.0  Report of Klan Activity in Ardmore, 1921 
    </h3>
    <figure>
    <figcaption style="clear: both; text-align: right;"> <b> <em> The New York Times. </em>July 4, 1924 </b> </figcaption>
    <img src="https://github.com/avelinepk/media/blob/main/klanmeetingardmore.jpg?raw=true" style="width: 400px; height: auto; float: right; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">   
     <figure> 
         
    <p>The incident described in the 1921 New York Times article provides a snapshot into the complex and tense racial dynamics of Ardmore during the inter-war era. The presence of a covert meeting of men in white coats, strongly implied to be members of the Ku Klux Klan, highlights the brazenness with which such hate groups operate, even in supposedly progressive northern cities following WWI. The fact that a Black man felt compelled to call the police to intervene suggests strength and resilience on behalf of the African American community, who almost certainly faced very real consequences for challenging the violent organization. </p> 
    <p>The fatal shooting of the officer during the altercation underscores the potential for volatility during such interactions and additionally helps contextualize the community fear surrounding such groups. This incident serves as a poignant reminder of the pervasive racism and racial violence that threatened many Black communities during the mid-20th century, especially in the wake of diminishing public knowledge on the state of racism in the North following reconstruction. </p>
    
  <h3> 6.0 Ardmore Resident Convicted of Murder: Sentenced to the Death Penalty
    </h3>
    <figure>
    <figcaption style="clear: both; text-align: left;"> <b> <em> The New York Times. </em>March 27, 1936 </b> </figcaption>
    <img src="https://github.com/avelinepk/media/blob/main/Haverford_Murder.jpg?raw=true" style="width: 400px; height: auto; float: left; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">   
     <figure> 
         
    <p> While the crime itself was committed and tried in Haverford, the case of Ardmore’s Roy Crittenton’s conviction and death sentencing sheds light on the pervasive racial bias within the Main Line (and American) legal system during the inter-war period, even in cases in which the defendant was certainly guilty. Crittenton, a Black man, was swiftly convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death for the murder of a fellow Haverford College employee Mary L. Ginder, a White woman. </p>
    <p>While the crime itself is unfortunately straightforward—Crittenton turned himself into the police and confessed to the murder—the subsequent process of appeal to the Supreme Court reveals troubling aspects of his trial, including overtly racist comments made by jurors. Despite Crittenton’s obvious culpability in the crime, readers should remain reminded that racial bias did not only affect the ultimate verdict issued on crimes but also the punishment that was ultimately administered. The discrimination present in the courtroom eroded the fundamental integrity and fairness meant to be inherent to the United States legal process, even if the guilt was exhibited. </p>
	<p>Critton’s subsequent appeal to the Supreme Court on the grounds of racial discrimination reveals more troubling aspects of his trial. The Court’s opinion unanimously upheld the punishment, decreeing that “ It is within the discretion of the trial judge, of his motion, to order the withdrawal of a juror on the ground that the remarks of counsel were improper and materially detrimental to the fair trial of the case.” While such a principle may appear fair on the surface, it leaves room for pervasive racial bias amongst jurors so long as the presiding judge permits the language. Seeing the judgment in this light can shed light on the profound injustices experienced by African Americans seeking equal treatment under the law on the Main Line. </p>
